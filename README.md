# EduData-Governance-Analytics



**Description:**  
This project addresses fragmented and inconsistent educational data that hinder accurate student performance measurement. An ETL pipeline with Airbyte and AWS RDS was implemented, and interactive Power BI dashboards were built, ensuring compliance with DAMA, PDPL, and NDMO frameworks for secure and high-quality data. give name foer this project
